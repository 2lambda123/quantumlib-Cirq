## Cirq viz

### Scratch pad/things to do

- directory structure refactoring?
- **Testing, which framework?-- important**
    - [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/)
    - [Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/)
- add a server for live reloading/development purposes
    - maybe would be good to have this in a separate directory so that ppl who want to develop can just go in there and do so.
    - [live-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/live-server) via npm
    - Server should be run using nodejs for consistency, not python
- examples?

### Currently installed packages (see package-lock.json)
- [three.js](https://threejs.org)

### Directions
Install packages with `npm install`.
