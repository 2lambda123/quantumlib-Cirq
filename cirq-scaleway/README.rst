`Cirq <https://quantumai.google/cirq>`__ is a Python library for writing, manipulating, and optimizing quantum
circuits and running them against quantum computers and simulators.

This module is **cirq-scaleway**, which provides everything you'll need to run Cirq quantum algorithms on Scaleway Quantum as a Service (QaaS).

Documentation
-------------

To get started with Scaleway Quantum as a Service (QaaS), checkout the following guide and tutorial:

- `Access and authentication <https://quantumai.google/cirq/scaleway/access>`__
- `Getting started guide <https://quantumai.google/cirq/tutorials/scaleway/getting_started>`__

Installation
------------

To install the stable version of only **cirq-scaleway**, use `pip install cirq-scaleway`.

Note, that this will install both **cirq-scaleway** and **cirq-core**.

To get all the optional modules installed, you'll have to use `pip install cirq` or `pip install cirq~=1.0.dev` for the pre-release version.

Development
------------

Please see Cirq `development documentation <../docs/dev/development.md>`_.
