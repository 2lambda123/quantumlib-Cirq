    These strings are not intended to be human readable.

    The returned string will have digit-runs zero-padded up to at least 8
    digits. That way, instead of 'a10' coming before 'a2', 'a000010' will come
    after 'a000002'.

    Also, the original length of each digit-run is appended after the
    zero-padded run. This is so that 'a0' continues to come before 'a00'.
