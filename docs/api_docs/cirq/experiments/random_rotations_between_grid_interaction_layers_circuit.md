<!-- Placeholder for "Used in" -->

This construction is based on the circuits used in the paper
https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1666-5.

The generated circuit consists of a number of "cycles", this number being
specified by `depth`. Each cycle is actually composed of two sub-layers:
a layer of single-qubit gates followed by a layer of two-qubit gates.
The single-qubit gates are chosen randomly from the gates specified by
`single_qubit_gates`, but with the constraint that no qubit is acted upon
by the same single-qubit gate in consecutive cycles. In the layer of
two-qubit gates, which pairs of qubits undergo interaction is determined
by `pattern`, which is a sequence of two-qubit interaction sets. The
set of interactions in a two-qubit layer rotates through this sequence.
The two-qubit operations themselves are generated by the call
`two_qubit_op_factory(a, b, prng)`, where `a` and `b` are the qubits and
`prng` is the pseudorandom number generator.

At the end of the circuit, an additional layer of single-qubit gates is
appended, subject to the same constraint regarding consecutive cycles
described above.

If only one choice of single-qubit gate is given, then the constraint
that excludes repeating single-qubit gates in consecutive cycles is not
enforced.
