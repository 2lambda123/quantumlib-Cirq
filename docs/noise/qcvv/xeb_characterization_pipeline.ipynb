    "The refit fidelities are almost the same as the original fidelities in this case, but are a bit better in some cases. The characterization procedure was able to identify some coherent error, but was not able to refit for all of the _incoherent_ error introduced by the depolarization. For more information on how XEB interacts with error, see [Coherent vs Incoherent Error with XEB](./coherent_vs_incoherent_xeb). "
