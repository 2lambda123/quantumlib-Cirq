    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Cirq's protocols are very similar concept to Python's built-in protocols that were introduced in [PEP 544](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0544/).\n",
    "Python's built-in protocols are extremely convenient, for example behind all the for loops and list comprehensions you can find the Iterator protocol.\n",
    "As long as an object has the `__iter__()` magic method that returns an iterator object, it has iterator support.\n",
    "An iterator object has to define `__iter__()` and `__next__()` magic methods, that defines the iterator protocol.\n",
    "The `iter(val)` builtin function returns an iterator for `val` if it defines the above methods, otherwise throws a `TypeError`. Cirq protocols work similarly.\n",
    "\n",
    "A canonical Cirq protocol example is the `unitary` protocol that allows to check the unitary matrix of values that support the protocol by calling `cirq.unitary(val)`."

    "The following family of protocols is an important and frequently used set of features of Cirq and it is worthwhile mentioning them and and how they interact with each other. They are, in the order of generality (starting with the least generic):\n",
    "\n",
    "* `*unitary`\n",
    "* `*mixture`\n",
    "* `*channel`\n",
    "\n",
    "All these protocols make it easier to work with different representations of quantum operators: finding that representation (`unitary`, `mixture`, `channel`), determining whether the operator has that representation (`has_*`) and applying them (`apply_*`) on a state vector. \n",
    "\n",
    "The `unitary` representation is the most special case, only applies when the quantum operator is unitary, and in this case represents it via the unitary matrix in the computational basis. We saw an example of the unitary protocol above.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `mixture` representation is a probabilistic representation of a quantum operator, where each possible unitary effect $U_i$ occurs with a certain probability $p_i$, where $\\sum p_i = 1$ In case the operator does not implement `SupportsMixture`, but does implement `SupportsUnitary`, `*mixture` protocols fall back to the `*unitary` methods, based on the simple correspondence: the $U$ is a mixture of a single unitary with probability $p=1$. \n"
