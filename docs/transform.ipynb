    "Simply put, a transformer is just a function that *transforms* an input circuit into an output circuit. The precide API for what qualifies as a valid cirq transformer will be defined later in the tutorial. \n",
    "\n",
    "Circuit transformations are often necessary to compile a user-defined circuit to an equivalent circuit which can be executed on a specific device or simulator. The compilation process often involves steps like:\n",
    "- Gate Decompositions: Rewrite the circuit using only gates that belong to the device target gateset, i.e. set of gates which the device can execute. \n",
    "- Qubit Mapping and Routing: Map the logic qubits in the input circuit to physical qubits on the device and insert appropriate swap operations such that final circuit respects the hardware topology. \n",
    "- Circuit Optimizations: Perform hardware specific optimizations, like merging and replacing connected components of 1 and 2 operations with more efficient rewrites, commuting Z gates through the circuit, aligning gates in moments etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Cirq provides many out-of-the-box transformers which can be used as individual compilation passes and also provides a general framework for users to create their own transformers using powerful primitives and bundle a bunch of transformers together to enable compiling circuits for specific targets.
