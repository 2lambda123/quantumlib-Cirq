# Tutorial

In this tutorial we will go from knowing nothing about Cirq to creating a
quantum variational algorithm. Note that this tutorial isn't a quantum
computing 101 tutorial, we assume familiarity of quantum computing at about
the level of the textbook "Quantum Computation and Quantum Information" by
Nielsen and Chuang.

To begin, please follow the instructions for installing Cirq.
