# How to Contribute

We'd love to accept your patches and contributions to this project. There are
just a few small guidelines you need to follow.

## Contributor License Agreement

Contributions to this project must be accompanied by a Contributor License
Agreement. You (or your employer) retain the copyright to your contribution;
this simply gives us permission to use and redistribute your contributions as
part of the project. Head over to <https://cla.developers.google.com/> to see
your current agreements on file or to sign a new one.

You generally only need to submit a CLA once, so if you've already submitted one
(even if it was for a different project), you probably don't need to do it
again.

## Code reviews

All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We
use GitHub pull requests for this purpose. Consult
[GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) for more
information on using pull requests.

Our code reviews also currently require a manual run of tests for
your pull request (due to a limitation while Cirq is a private repo).  To
Ydo this, you must first install the protobuf compiler:
```bash
sudo apt-get install protobuf-compiler
```
Then, after you have created your pull request, you should run
```bash
./continuous_integration/test-pull-request [pull_request_number] [access_token]
```
where ```[pull_request_number]``` is the number of your pull request,
and ```[access_token]``` is an api access key for github which you can
obtain by navigating to your github users Settings / Developer Settings /
Personal acess tokens [page](https://github.com/settings/tokens).
When the tests run successfully your pull request will automatically be
updated showing that these test have passed.
